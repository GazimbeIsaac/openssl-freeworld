make INSTALL_PREFIX = where to install, like rpm build root

rpm uses configure with:

--prefix = /usr
--openssldir = /etc/pki/tls

in openssldir:
openssl.cnf
certs/
man/...
misc/...
private/

in prefix:
lib64/libs...
lib64/engines/...
lib64/pkgconfig/...
include/openssl/...
bin/...

  --prefix=DIR  Install in DIR/bin, DIR/lib, DIR/include/openssl.
	        Configuration files used by OpenSSL will be in DIR/ssl
                or the directory specified by --openssldir.

  --openssldir=DIR Directory for OpenSSL files. If no prefix is specified,
                the library files and binaries are also installed there.


  4. If everything tests ok, install OpenSSL with

       $ make install

     This will create the installation directory (if it does not exist) and
     then the following subdirectories:

       certs           Initially empty, this is the default location
                       for certificate files.
       man/man1        Manual pages for the 'openssl' command line tool
       man/man3        Manual pages for the libraries (very incomplete)
       misc            Various scripts.
       private         Initially empty, this is the default location
                       for private key files.

     If you didn't choose a different installation prefix, the
     following additional subdirectories will be created:

       bin             Contains the openssl binary and a few other 
                       utility programs. 
       include/openssl Contains the header files needed if you want to
                       compile programs with libcrypto or libssl.
       lib             Contains the OpenSSL library files themselves.

     Use "make install_sw" to install the software without documentation,
     and "install_docs_html" to install HTML renditions of the manual
     pages.

     Package builders who want to configure the library for standard
     locations, but have the package installed somewhere else so that
     it can easily be packaged, can use

       $ make INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/package-root install

     (or specify "--install_prefix=/tmp/package-root" as a configure
     option).  The specified prefix will be prepended to all
     installation target filenames.



in openssl rpm:

/etc/pki/tls/...
/etc/pki/CA/...
/usr/bin/openssl
/usr/share/doc/{%name}/...
/usr/share/man/...

in openssl-libs rpm:

/etc/pki/tls/...
/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf
/usr/lib64/libs...
/usr/lib64/openssl/engines/...

in openssl-devel rpm:
